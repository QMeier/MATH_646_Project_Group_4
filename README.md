# MATH_646_Project_Group_4
This repo contains the code and report done for the Fall 2018 section of Math 646 - Complex Analysis at the University of Kansas. We needed to investigate some concept relating to Complex Analysis, in our case Quantum Mechanics, and print a 3D representation. We chose to study how two complex wave functions which satisfy the Schrodinger equation interact in time and space by modeling the total probability amplitude as they propagate through space and time.
