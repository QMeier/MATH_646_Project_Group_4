# MATH_646_Project_Group_4

This repo holds the code and report done for the Fall 2018 class of MATH 646 Complex Analysis at the University of Kansas. We needed to investigate some concept relating to Complex Analysis, in our case Quantum Mechanics, and print a 3D representation. We chose to study how two complex wavefunctions interact in time and space by modeling the total probability amplitude as they propagate through space and time.
